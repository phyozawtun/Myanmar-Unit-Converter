              Why all Myanmar people are seriously prefer to use traditional mess unit
          </h1>
          <p>
              Reason why all Myanmar people are seriously prefer to use traditional mess unit when buying gold jewellery even they don’t have knowledge on that unit.
          <p>
          </p>
              Myanmar is only country which using both British Matix weight system and US weight system. Every one in Myanmar have a little or full understanding on units conversation nature between Matrix system like Lb, Etc, Etc. And also they have knowledge on US weight system such as mg, kg and etc.
          <p>
          </p>
              We, our people, the only people of the country who have knowledge on two units system. The next fact is most people in Myanmar, actually everyone have no idea on Myanmar weight units conversation such as Kyat, Pell and Ywee.
          <p>
          </p>
              Yes! Yes! They understand the both US and UK weight system but they don’t know  about their tradional weight system. The srious things is when they buy gold for jewelly, they only want to buy gold and jewellery in Myanmar weight units. The answer of Myanmar people is always no, and never, if a gold shop is selling their product in UK or US weight system.
          <p>
          </p>
              Actually, In Myanmar, people used to buy gold and jewellery with Myanmar units is traditional since our great grand father generation. They don’t have unit convention knowledge between Kyat, Pell and Ywee. But everyone is only familiar with Kyat unit. They used to express the value of gold in Kyats unit. Myanmar people have senses and can guest the market value of gold, when someone conversation is mention the weight of an gold jeweller in Kyats units. The market price of the gold is always anounce only inn Kyats units. Gold jewellery buyer don’t need to have knowledge on traditional units conversion between Kyats and it smaller unit Pell and Yeww, because in Myanmar the Gold shop never make a mistake on unit conventions. And In Myanmar gold shop are more like bank. Their customers can return the jewellery with market price. People buy the gold jewellery as investment.
          <p>
          </p>
              Some Myanmar people trust their gold shop more than the banks. As per facts from Myanmar Banking timelines, saveral timestamps in that timelines were proofed these people truse on gold shopt were not wrong. In the time of writing this article, April 2021, all banks in Myanmar limit the amount of daily widthdraw. Their daily limit is unbelievable, it is less than 200 USD. To widthdraw their money, large amounts of people are querying in front of every single ATM across the country. At the same time, the all the large gold shops were never limit their product return price from their customer.
